At the population level, variation between societies may be structured by a range of macro‐evolutionary factors, including ecological and environmental resources, shared ancestry, spatial proximity, and covarying social practices. Kinship terminology systems are varying linguistic paradigms that denote familial social relationships of kin and non‐kin. Systems vary by the kinds of salient distinctions that are made (e.g., age, gender, generation) and the extent to which different kinds of kin are called by the same term. Here, we explore two kinds of explanations for an observed typology of kin terms for cousins. The first one derives the typology from a learning bottleneck linked to population size. This would lead to a correlation between community size and the type of kinship system. The second one derives it from a set of social practices, particularly marriage and transfer of resources that might shape kinship systems. Using a global ethnographic database of over a thousand societies, we show that marriage rules and shared linguistic affiliation have a significant influence on the type of kinship system found in a society. This remains true if we control for the effect of spatial proximity and cultural ancestry. By combining cognitive and historic approaches to this aspect of kinship, we suggest broader implications for the study of human social cognition in general.","tags":null,"title":"Social Practice and Shared History, Not Social Scale, Structure Cross‐Cultural Complexity in Kinship Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555286400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555286400,"objectID":"bb6e4b5d297ac3b76d77b39f60d99a02","permalink":"/talk/2019nouniversalsintheevolutionofkinshipterminologiesmaxplanckinstituteforthescienceofhumanhistory/","publishdate":"2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019nouniversalsintheevolutionofkinshipterminologiesmaxplanckinstituteforthescienceofhumanhistory/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"No universals in the evolution of kinship terminologies","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554940800,"objectID":"725a11281a29223d00dfa79a8bf69209","permalink":"/talk/2019anewlookatnerloveromney1964maxplanckinstitueforthesocialanthropology/","publishdate":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019anewlookatnerloveromney1964maxplanckinstitueforthesocialanthropology/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A new look at Nerlove \u0026 Romney (1964)","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548374400,"objectID":"be85e3279088496dec5cf1cf6d97841c","permalink":"/talk/2019rethinkingkinshipevolutiondatabehaviouruniversityofauckland/","publishdate":"2019-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019rethinkingkinshipevolutiondatabehaviouruniversityofauckland/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Rethinking Kinship: Evolution, data, \u0026 Behaviour","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548028800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548028800,"objectID":"80c752e781bab9df786d98e4ac50d896","permalink":"/talk/2019rethinkingkinshipevolutiondatabehaviouruniversityofwaikato/","publishdate":"2019-01-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019rethinkingkinshipevolutiondatabehaviouruniversityofwaikato/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Rethinking Kinship: Evolution, data, \u0026 Behaviour","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" I\u0026rsquo;ve been using BayesTraits for the last year or so, and had developed some packages to make it easy to create data for BayesTraits and to read in the output - which I\u0026rsquo;ve put into the R package bayestraitr.\nYou can check out the code and some more examples on the github page\nHere I will walk through how to use it!\nInstalling To install this package run this line:\ndevtools::install_github('SamPassmore/bayestraitr')\nand load with\nlibrary(bayestraitr)\nReading output files There are three functions in this package at the moment for reading in BayesTrait *.Log files, *.Schedule files, \u0026amp; *.Stones\nlog = bt_read.log('./bayestrait_output/Artiodactyl.txt.Log.txt')\nWill return a dataframe of the log matrix.

One aspect of history that has only recently begun to be examined is deep cultural ancestry, i.e. the vertical relationships of descent between cultures, which can be represented by a phylogenetic tree of descent. Here, we test whether deep cultural ancestry predicts the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) for 44 Eurasian countries, using language ancestry as a proxy for cultural relatedness and controlling for three additional factors—geographical proximity, religion and former communism. While cultural ancestry alone predicts HDI and its subcomponents (income, health and education indices), when geographical proximity is included only income and health indices remain significant and the effect is small. When communism and religion variables are included, cultural ancestry is no longer a significant predictor; communism significantly negatively predicts HDI, income and health indices, and Muslim percentage of the population significantly negatively predicts education index, although the latter result may not be robust. These findings indicate that geographical proximity and recent cultural history—especially communism—are more important than deep cultural factors in current human development and suggest the efficacy of modern policy initiatives is not tightly constrained by cultural ancestry.","tags":null,"title":"Deep cultural ancestry and human development indicators across nation states","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528243200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528243200,"objectID":"185e5da4bab09ccd4f8ca8b1746a5af2","permalink":"/talk/2018aphylogeneticapproachtokinshipuniversityoftartu/","publishdate":"2018-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2018aphylogeneticapproachtokinshipuniversityoftartu/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A phylogenetic approach to kinship","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1505174400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1505174400,"objectID":"e01756cf96a16a85a778732830268c60","permalink":"/talk/2017testingtheassumptionsofkinshipmaxplanckinstitueforthescienceofhumanhistory/","publishdate":"2017-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017testingtheassumptionsofkinshipmaxplanckinstitueforthescienceofhumanhistory/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Testing the assumptions of kinship","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1495584000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495584000,"objectID":"a9932ae2af688d8e28140da419b21ac6","permalink":"/talk/2017sharedancestryshowskinshipisconserveduniversityofbirmingham/","publishdate":"2017-05-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017sharedancestryshowskinshipisconserveduniversityofbirmingham/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Shared ancestry shows kinship is conserved","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493337600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493337600,"objectID":"2a30afa564815e19fd40858259bd22e1","permalink":"/talk/2017isitweirdtomarryyourcousincrossculturalviewsonkinshipuniversityofbristol/","publishdate":"2017-04-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017isitweirdtomarryyourcousincrossculturalviewsonkinshipuniversityofbristol/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Is it weird to marry your cousin?

Regime changes, protest movements, and stock market and default shocks can have ramifications across the globe. Quantitative models have made great strides at predicting these events in recent decades but incorporate few explicitly measured cultural variables. However, in recent years cultural evolutionary theory has emerged as a major paradigm to understand the inheritance and diffusion of human cultural variation. Here, we combine these two strands of research by proposing that measures of socio-linguistic affiliation derived from language phylogenies track variation in cultural norms that influence how political and economic changes diffuse across the globe. First, we show that changes over time in a country’s democratic or autocratic character correlate with simultaneous changes among their socio-linguistic affiliations more than with changes of spatially proximate countries. Second, we find that models of changes in sovereign default status favor including socio-linguistic affiliations in addition to spatial data. These findings suggest that better measurement of cultural networks could be profoundly useful to policy makers who wish to diversify commercial, social, and other forms of investment across political and economic risks on an international scale.","tags":null,"title":"Shared cultural history as a predictor of political and economic changes among nation states","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461711600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461711600,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Previous research into pre-European deforestation across the Pacific indicated a major effect of environment but did not account for cultural variation or control for dependencies in the data due to shared cultural ancestry and geographic proximity. The relative importance of environment and culture on Pacific deforestation and forest replacement and the extent to which environmental impact is constrained by cultural ancestry therefore remain unexplored. Here we use comparative phylogenetic methods to model the effect of nine ecological and two cultural variables on pre-European Pacific forest outcomes at 80 locations across 67 islands. We show that some but not all ecological features remain important predictors of forest outcomes after accounting for cultural covariates and non-independence in the data. Controlling for ecology, cultural variation in agricultural intensification predicts deforestation and forest replacement, and there is some evidence that land tenure norms predict forest replacement. These findings indicate that, alongside ecology, cultural factors also predict pre-European Pacific forest outcomes. Although forest outcomes covary with cultural ancestry, this effect disappears after controlling for geographic proximity and ecology. This suggests that forest outcomes were not tightly constrained by colonists’ cultural ancestry, but instead reflect a combination of ecological constraints and the short-term responses of each culture in the face of those constraints.","tags":[],"title":"Cultural and environmental predictors of pre-European deforestation on Pacific islands","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
